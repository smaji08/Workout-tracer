### User Story

AS A user, 
I WANT to be able to view create and track daily workouts, and 
I WANT to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day, and
I SHOULD also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I SHOULD be able to track my distance traveled,
SO THAT I reach my fitness goals quicker when I track my workout progress.
